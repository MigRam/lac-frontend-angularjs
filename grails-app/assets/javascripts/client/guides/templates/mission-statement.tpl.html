          <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
          <p>
            The Language Archive Cologne (LAC) supports research, learning and
            teaching with high quality and dependable digital language
            resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            The LAC facilitates free and open online access to research data. It
            does this by preserving digital audio and video data, annotations,
            and other digital language data in the long term, and by promoting
            and disseminating these resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            The LAC promotes open and sustainable practices in the use of
            digital language data in the humanities and provides technical
            advice to the research community, and supports the deployment of
            digital technologies in research and teaching.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following this, the mission of the LAC repository is to serve as the
            repository of a CLARIN-D resource centre. The mission of CLARIN-D is
            to provide “linguistic data, tools and services in an integrated,
            interoperable and scalable infrastructure for the social sciences
            and humanities“ (<a
              href="http://de.clarin.eu/en/home-en.html"
              title="CLARIN-EU"

              >http://de.clarin.eu/en/home-en.html</a
            >). Therefore, a repository in which data, tools and according
            metadata is archived on a long term basis has to be operated by such
            a resource centre.
